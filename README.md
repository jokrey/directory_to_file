# directory_to_file
Did you ever want a way to encode a directory into a file and back? But without encryption or compression? And you never heard of zip? No? Well here you go anyway...

This is nothing but a semi interactive command line interface to use the old length indicator based encoding scheme of jokrey utilities.
It can rather quickly encode entire directories into a single file. However, no encryption or compression occurs in the rust version.
Hey, 'useless' is a strong word.
